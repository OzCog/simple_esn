Simple ESN
==========

simple_esn implement a Python class of simple Echo State Networks models
witin the Scikit-learn framework. It is intended to be a fast-and-easy
transformation of an input signal in a reservoir of neurons. The classification
or regression could be done with any scikit-learn classifier/regressor.

The SimpleESN object could be part of a Pipeline and its parameter space could
be explored with a GridSearchCV for example.

The code is inspired by the "minimalistic ESN example" proposed by Mantas
Lukoševičius. It is licenced under GPLv3.
